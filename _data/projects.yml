- title: "Do Multilingual Transformers Encode Paninian Grammatical Relations?"
  description: "Investigated how multilingual transformers (XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, IndicBERT) internally encode grammatical information from the Paninian framework across seven Indian languages. Used diagnostic probing to analyze layer-wise encoding patterns, finding syntactic dependencies peak in middle-upper layers (6-9) while lexical features emerge earlier."
