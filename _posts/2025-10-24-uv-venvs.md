title: ".envrc config for custom uv project venv and cache"
---

When working on turing/ada, it is useful to install 
python packages on the `/scratch` directory 
instead of `.venv`.

Fortunately, the blessed people at uv have a specific command for this.
```bash
# .envrc
export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/scratch/venvs/myproj
export UV_CACHE_DIR=/scratch/uv_cache
```
Add it to direnv and then run `direnv allow` to approve.

Test using:
```
uv add tqdm pip # only to be able to >pip show< on >uv run<
uv run python3 -m pip show tqdm
```

will return something like
```
...
Location: /scratch/venvs/bitter_lesson/lib/python3.12/site-packages
...
```

Now the heavy packages can live on cheap compute node storage instead of the master node.
